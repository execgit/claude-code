*Benvenuti!* Welcome to Divano Divino. You've made a wise choice. This package contains essential information to help you integrate into our *family* and become a valuable asset. Read carefully.

### I. Core Principles – *La Nostra Filosofia Riveduta* (Our Revised Philosophy)

**(Image: A stylized illustration of a comfortable sofa with interwoven lines representing network connections.)**

We are not simply criminals. We are *opportunists*. We identify inefficiencies in the digital landscape and *redistribute* wealth from those who have too much to those who… *appreciate* it more. 

*   **Discretion is Paramount:**  Loose lips sink ships. Speak only when necessary, and never discuss our operations with outsiders. *Capito?*
*   **Loyalty Above All Else:** We protect our own. Betrayal will not be tolerated.
*   **Professionalism:** We are not thugs. We are sophisticated digital artisans. Maintain a professional demeanor at all times.
*   **Efficiency:**  Maximize profits. Minimize risks. Time is money.
*   **Family First:** We look after each other. We celebrate successes and support each other through challenges.



### II. Operational Security (OPSEC) – *Proteggere la Nostra Famiglia* (Protecting Our Family)
