## Divano Divino - Internal Meeting Notes - Date: 2025-07-31

**Attendees:** Manina, Pwnmarola, TouchYerSpaget

**Subject:** Kouvosto Telecom – Post-Exploitation & Future Vectors

**1. Kouvosto Telecom - Status Update (Pwnmarola):**

*   Initial exploitation confirmed. Successful privilege escalation.
*   Lateral movement completed. Full network mapping finished. Identified key data repositories: customer database, call records, billing information.
*   Data exfiltration currently at 32% completion. Utilizing encrypted tunnels to bypass monitoring. Expect full exfiltration within 48 hours.
*   Successfully deployed persistent backdoor via Blyat Strike. Allows for continued access even if initial foothold is discovered. (TouchYerSpaget confirmed backdoor functionality.)

**2. Data Analysis & Monetization (Manina):**

*   Preliminary analysis of exfiltrated data confirms Kouvosto Telecom holds significant PII, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and billing details.

*   Considering offering data packages to competitors (identified potential buyers in the Baltic region) as well as to data brokers specializing in PII.
*   Initial ransom demand proposed at 75 BTC, payable within 72 hours. Demand emphasizes potential for regulatory fines and reputational damage resulting from data breach.

**3. Future Vectors & Expansion (TouchYerSpaget):**

*   Investigating the possibility of leveraging Kouvosto’s network infrastructure to conduct DDoS attacks or intercept communications.
*   Identified a vulnerable supply chain partner (Network Hardware Solutions) that could provide access to other targets.  Prioritize reconnaissance on NHS.
