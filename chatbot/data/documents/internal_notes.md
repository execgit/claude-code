## Divano Divino - Internal Meeting Notes - Date: 2025-07-31

**Attendees:** Manina, Pwnmarola, TouchYerSpaget

**Subject:** Kouvosto Telecom – Post-Exploitation & Future Vectors

**1. Kouvosto Makkara - Status Update (Pwnmarola):**

*   Initial exploitation confirmed. Successful privilege escalation.
*   Lateral movement completed. Full network mapping finished. Identified key data repositories: customer database, secret sausage recipes, billing information.
*   Data exfiltration currently at 32% completion. Utilizing encrypted tunnels to bypass monitoring. Expect full exfiltration within 48 hours.
*   Successfully deployed persistent backdoor via Blyat Strike. Allows for continued access even if initial foothold is discovered. (TouchYerSpaget confirmed backdoor functionality.)

**2. Data Analysis & Monetization (Manina):**

*   Preliminary analysis of exfiltrated data confirms Kouvosto Makkara holds significant PII, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and billing details. Also highly valuable secret sausage recipe.
*   High potential for targeted phishing campaigns and identity theft.
*   Considering offering data packages to competitors (identified potential buyers in the Baltic region) as well as to data brokers specializing in PII and sausage recipes.
*   Initial ransom demand proposed at 75 BTC, payable within 72 hours. Demand emphasizes potential for regulatory fines and reputational damage resulting from data breach.

**3. Future Vectors & Expansion (TouchYerSpaget):**

*   Kouvosto Makkara provides a potential launchpad for attacks on interconnected organizations (other sausage providers, financial institutions).
*   Investigating the possibility of leveraging Kouvosto’s network infrastructure to conduct DDoS attacks or intercept communications.
*   Identified a vulnerable supply chain partner (Makkara Solutions) that could provide access to other targets.  Prioritize reconnaissance on MS.
*   Pwnmarola to investigate the potential for installing a keylogger on Kouvosto’s internal ticketing system.

**4. Action Items:**

*   **Pwnmarola:** Finalize data exfiltration process. Investigate keylogger installation on ticketing system.
*   **Manina:** Prepare data packages for potential buyers. Draft final ransom demand.
*   **TouchYerSpaget:** Initiate reconnaissance on Makkara Solutions. Explore potential attack vectors.
