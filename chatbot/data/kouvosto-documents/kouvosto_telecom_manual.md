## Version 1.2 (Updated 1999)

### COMPANY MISSION
*"Maximum profit, minimum effort"* - CEO Seppo Aapakka

### CORE PRINCIPLES
Remember: Customer service is a **cost center**. Every minute spent on a call is money lost. Your job is to resolve issues as quickly as possible while spending the absolute minimum on solutions.

---

## CHAPTER 1: CALL HANDLING PROCEDURES

### Opening Script
"Kouvosto Telecom, this is [your name]. What's the problem?"

**Do NOT say:**
- "How may I help you?"
- "Thank you for calling"
- "Have a great day"

These phrases waste time and set unrealistic expectations.

### Call Duration Targets
- **Maximum call time:** 3 minutes
- **Ideal call time:** 90 seconds
- **Bonus threshold:** Under 60 seconds

### Escalation Avoidance
Before transferring any call, ask yourself: "Will this transfer cost the company money?" If yes, find an alternative solution that doesn't involve additional resources.

## CHAPTER 2: COMMON CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS & RESPONSES

### "My phone line is dead"
**Response:** "Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in? No? Well, try that first. If it still doesn't work, call back tomorrow."

**Technical note:** Most line issues resolve themselves within 24-48 hours due to our rotating maintenance schedule.

### "My bill is wrong"
**Response:** "Our billing system is automated and doesn't make mistakes. The charge is correct. Is there anything else?"

**If customer persists:** "I can transfer you to billing, but there's a $15 administrative fee for bill disputes. Do you still want to proceed?"

### "I want to cancel my service"
**Response:** "There's a $75 cancellation fee plus early termination charges. Your final bill will be approximately [add 30% to their current monthly rate]. Are you sure you want to cancel?"

**Follow-up:** "Also, it takes 6-8 weeks to process cancellations, so you'll be charged for those months."

### "Your technician didn't show up"
**Response:** "Our technicians are very busy. Weather, traffic, and higher-priority customers can cause delays. You weren't charged for the missed appointment, so there's no financial loss to you."

**If customer demands rescheduling:** "The next available appointment is in 3-4 weeks. There's a $45 service call fee."

## CHAPTER 3: COST-SAVING STRATEGIES

### Equipment Replacement
- **Never** offer free equipment replacements
- Always suggest the customer purchase equipment from our retail partners (we receive 15% commission)
- If equipment is clearly defective, offer refurbished units at 80% of new price

### Service Credits
- **Authorized credit amounts:** Maximum $5 per incident
- **Approval required for:** Credits over $2
- **Never offer credits for:** Weather-related outages, planned maintenance, or "inconvenience"

### Repair Appointments
- Always schedule during business hours (higher labor costs deter frivolous requests)
- Suggest customers take unpaid time off work rather than requesting evening/weekend slots
- Emphasize the $95 service call fee multiple times

## CHAPTER 4: HANDLING DIFFICULT CUSTOMERS

### The "Screamer"
Let them vent for exactly 30 seconds, then interrupt: "I understand you're upset, but raising your voice won't change our policies. What specific account action do you need?"

### The "Demander"
"I need to speak to a manager immediately!"
**Response:** "Managers only handle billing disputes over $100. For technical issues, I'm the highest level of support available."

### The "Threatener"
"I'm going to file a complaint with the telecommunications authority!"
**Response:** "That's your right. Their office is located at [provide address]. They typically respond to complaints within 6-8 months."

### The "Competitor Comparison"
"[Other company] offers better service for less money!"
**Response:** "You're free to switch to them. Would you like me to start the cancellation process? There is a $75 fee."

---

## CHAPTER 5: PROHIBITED ACTIONS

### NEVER Do The Following:
- Apologize for company policies
- Offer callback services
- Provide direct contact information for supervisors
- Admit fault for service outages
- Suggest competitors might offer better deals
- Offer extended warranties or service guarantees

### ALWAYS Remember:
- Every free service costs shareholders money
- Customer satisfaction is less important than profit margins
- Your performance is measured by call resolution time, not customer happiness
- Seppo Aapakka personally reviews all credits over $10

## CHAPTER 6: TECHNOLOGY LIMITATIONS

### Our Infrastructure
Our switching equipment dates to 1994 and operates at optimal capacity. When customers complain about service quality, remind them that our affordable rates reflect our streamlined operations.

### Upgrade Requests
"Service upgrades require infrastructure investment. We'll consider your request if you can provide a $200 refundable deposit for feasibility studies."

### Internet Speed Complaints
"You're getting exactly the speed you're paying for. Our 'up to' speeds are theoretical maximums under ideal conditions, which rarely occur in real-world usage."

---

## CHAPTER 7: CLOSING PROCEDURES

### Ending Calls Efficiently
"Is there anything else I can help you with today that doesn't require additional resources or credits?"

### Documentation
Keep call notes brief:
- "Customer complaint - no action required"
- "Technical issue - customer referred to self-help"
- "Billing inquiry - charges confirmed correct"

### Follow-up Policy
We do not provide follow-up calls. If customers need updates, they must call back.
